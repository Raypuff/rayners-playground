## Rayner's Playground

Hello and welcome to my Github Repo for Rayner's playground!

This is just a small little project by me to practice different HTML/CSS/JS/React/etc. skills so that I can visualize it and improve myself.

List of Ideas:
- Metronome
- Shower thoughts
- Firebase authentication
- Different brand themes for different pages

If you have read this far and you are not Rayner, I don't know why you are here HAHA... But thanks I guess
